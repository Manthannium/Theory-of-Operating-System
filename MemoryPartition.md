# Memory Partition
Static Partition (fixed sized discrete blocks) and Dynamic Partition (Continuous memory allocation)

### Static Partition
```
Discrete Blocks of Fixed size are avaiable in memory
Either full or no allocation can be done. Partial allocation or Merging of blocks is not allowed.
Static partition causes fragmentation (waste of memory)
```
Internal Fragmentation
```
It is caused by job which is lower memory need that alloted. Thus forming holes
```
External Fragmentation
```
It is felt to unalloted job iff sum of available memory > required memory
```
